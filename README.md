# Mutton-Time-Series
Australia is one of the largest exporters of red meat in the world. However, over the past two decades, the meat production has significantly reduced mostly due to the persisting dry conditions particularly in the interior regions of Australia. This report analyses the monthly production of mutton in Australia since 1972 and forecasts the amount of mutton that would be produced in the near future using time series analysis techniques.
